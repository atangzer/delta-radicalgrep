# CSV2JSON

CSV2JSON is a tool that converts CSV files to JSON. 

## Specification

​	CSV2JSON accepts as input standard CSV files using commas as field delimiters and line breaks as record delimiters. A JSON file consisting of an array of objects is output. 

​	Each record in the CSV file is represented as an object in the JSON file. Each field in a given CSV record is represented by an name-value pair in the related JSON object. White-space surrounding field contents in the CSV file is not ignored and will be preserved in the JSON name-value pair.



CSV2JSON can be called from the parabix-devel directory using the following terminal command:

````
build\bin\csv2json <filename>
````



For example:

````
bin\csv2json ..\QA\csv2json\testcases\testcase_group.csv
````

Should yield the following output:
