# README-radicalcount

Radical Count is a program built based off of `ucount`. Given file(s) and the Kangxi radical(s), it counts the occurences of characters with the corresponding radical in the input file(s).

For more information on the Kangxi Radical System, please visit: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kangxi_radical or https://www.yellowbridge.com/chinese/radicals.php

## **Installation**

To build radical grep, the working environment needs to have all requirements of the icgrep build met. icgrep must also be built beforehand.

After the above has been done, run  `make`  and `make check` on the terminal to build the software and run the test suite.

To build only Radical Grep and it's dependencies, run `make radicalcount`.

After everything passes, you are ready to run Radical Count.

## **How to Run Radical Count**

Build the program by typing `make radicalcount` into the terminal. Go into the bin diretory and run the following command to use Radical Count.

    ./radicalcount <Radical Expression> <Path(s) of Input File(s)>

## Example 1

    Input: 氵_ ../QA/radicaltest/testfiles/test1
    Output: 氵: 3       ../QA/radicaltest/testfiles/test1

## Example 2

    Input: 氵_子_ ../QA/radicaltest/testfiles/test1
    Output:     氵: 3       ../QA/radicaltest/testfiles/test1
                子: 4       ../QA/radicaltest/testfiles/test1

## Example 3

    Input: 氵_子_ ../QA/radicaltest/testfiles/test1 ../QA/radicaltest/testfiles/test2
    Output: File 0:
                氵: 3       ../QA/radicaltest/testfiles/test1
                子: 4       ../QA/radicaltest/testfiles/test1
            File 1:
                氵: 7       ../QA/radicaltest/testfiles/test2
                子: 7       ../QA/radicaltest/testfiles/test2

            Total Count of 氵: 10
            Total Count of 子: 11
    
###### *Inputs of 2 radicals returns the count of each radical, and not the number of consecutive occurences (i.e. phrases).

## **Future Improvements**
* Add functionality to count the number of consecutive occurences (i.e. phrases).
